I should point out that their Jekyll theme has some flaws that I'm gonna try to pull to the main repository.\r\n* Background photo taken by an excellent photographer and designer called [Elaine Li](http://www.elaine.li/).\r\n* Social media icons are a part of the excellent [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
