Note that it's not possible to make a good screenshot of the whole website because the left sidebar is not static.

## Credits

* Design by [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/) (original template is called [Strata](http://html5up.net/strata)).
* Design converted to Jekyll ([Strata Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/CloudCannon/Strata-Jekyll-Theme)) done by [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com/). I should point out that their Jekyll theme has some flaws that I'm gonna try to pull to the main repository.
* Background photo taken by an excellent photographer and designer called [Elaine Li](http://www.elaine.li/).
* Social media icons are a part of the excellent [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
